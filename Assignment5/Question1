Question 1 

Finally : 
	Finally block is a part of exception handling in Java. The finally block gets executed matter what i.e., 
  even if the try block is successful or unsuccessful. The Compiler first executes the try block, if an exception is thrown, 
  catch block is executed and immediately goes to finally. If an exception is not thrown, catch block is skipped and finally 
  is executed.Therefore, we put in the code / statements that we want to be executed in either situation in the finally block.


Final :
	Final is a keyword that is used when you do not want something to be modified or to remain a constant. 
  It is used on a class, method, variable and also to a reference. 
How it behaves :
	1. Class : when a class is made final, it cannot be inherited. Since the class itself is final, its methods need not be 
     marked explicitly.
	2. Methods : such methods cannot be overridden. They can only be used in its original form.
	3. Variable : final variables once assigned to a value during initialization, cannot be modified as long as the class 
     its defined in exists. example : PI = 22 / 7
	4. Reference : when a reference variable is declared final and assigned to an object, itâ€™s done, it cannot be assigned to 
     any other object no matter what
