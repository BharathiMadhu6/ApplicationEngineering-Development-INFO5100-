Order of statements :

In the main method :
 - Class B's object 'b' is created
 - list object is created and the elements (1,2,3) are added
 - Class B's addAll() method is called and the list is passed as its argument
        - In Class B's addAll() :
          - addCount is initially : 0
          - c.size() = 3
          - addCount = 3
          - next class A's addAll() method is called
            - In Class A's addAll() :
              - Iterator object it is created
              - it.hasNext() will be true
              - this.add(it.next()) method will call Class B's add() method
                 - In Class B's add() method :
                    - addCount ++ will hold : 4
                    - call the Class A's add() method 
                        - In Class A's add() method :
                            - add method of list is used to add the object into it
                            - and return true
                    - true is returned to Class B's add() method
              - return true 
              - Class B's add() is called 
                - addCount ++ will hold = 5
                  - Class A's add() is called and element is added to list
              - Class B's add() is called
                - addCount ++ will hold = 6
            - In class A's addAll() method while statement will not hold and the control is returned to main()
              
  - In main() method print statement : 
    - b.getAddCount() will return 6 
    - b.getI() will return 0 
    - 6 + 0 = 6
